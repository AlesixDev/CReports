# Description ❓

This is a Minecraft plugin coded in spigot with the Paper framework. The plugin is about the fact that a player can report other players and save this in a database where a person with appropriate rights can query them in a GUI.

# Last commit 💯

- I removed the commands from the plugin.yml because it broke the plugin
- I added the paginated GUI (FINALLY)

# Server Status ✅

- 🟩 WORKING

# TODO ⭕

- I need to fix that if the command has not got any mentioned required permission then it's still required for some reason
- I need to remove the 'Thing' text from the lore in the report menu
- I still need to do some fixes in the GUI but it's already done
