# Description ❓

This is a Minecraft plugin coded in spigot with the Paper framework. The plugin is about the fact that a player can report other players and save this in a database where a person with appropriate rights can query them in a GUI.

# Last commit 💯

- I removed the 'THING' text from the lore from the report item by changing the item to PAPER.
- I added that if the GUI is automatically refreshes.
- I added to the config that you can make the report item by yourself.

# Server Status ✅

- 🟩 WORKING

# TODO ⭕

- I need to fix that if the command has not got any mentioned required permission then it's still required for some reason
